BFInfoWindow is based upon Google sample code for Maps API v3 that can be found here: http://gmaps-samples-v3.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/infowindow_custom/infowindow-custom.html

Unlike the sample code, BFInfoWindow can be used (eventually) exactly like the API's native InfoWindow class. This means you can use one BFInfoWindow for many markers like so:
  var myOptions = {
    zoom: 8,
    center: new google.maps.LatLng(-33.397, 150.644),
    mapTypeId: google.maps.MapTypeId.ROADMAP,
    sensor: 'true'
  }
  var map = new google.maps.Map(document.getElementById("map_canvas"), myOptions);
  infoBox = new BFInfoWindow();
  i = 1;

  var marker = new google.maps.Marker({
      position: new google.maps.LatLng(-34, 150),
      map: map
  });
  google.maps.event.addListener(marker, "click", function(e) {
    infoBox.set_content("Hello, you! This is click #" + i);
    infoBox.open(map, marker);
    i++;
  });
  
  var marker2 = new google.maps.Marker({
      position: new google.maps.LatLng(-35, 151),
      map: map
  });
  google.maps.event.addListener(marker2, "click", function(e) {
    infoBox.set_content(i + " is the loneliest number");
    infoBox.open(map, marker2);
    i++;
  });
